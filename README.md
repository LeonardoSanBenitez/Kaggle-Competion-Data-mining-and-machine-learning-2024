# Kaggle-Competion-Data-mining-and-machine-learning-2024
## Getting started

Run in the terminal, from the root folder:

```bash
make run-local
```


Run automated tests:
```bash
make test
```


This implementation was highly inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/LeonardoSanBenitez/tutorial-mlflow), written by myself circa 2023, and that I have used in talks and internals trainings in the company I've worked for, Skaylink.
